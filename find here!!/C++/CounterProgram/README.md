# Counter Program in C++

This is a simple counter program written in C++ that demonstrates basic input/output operations and looping concepts.

## Description

The Counter Program takes a number from the user and performs two operations:
1. **Count Up**: Counts from 1 to the entered number
2. **Countdown**: Counts down from the entered number to 1

## Features

- User input validation
- Forward counting (1 to N)
- Backward counting (N to 1)
- Clear output formatting

## How to Compile

```bash
g++ counter.cpp -o counter
```

## How to Run

```bash
./counter
```

## Example Usage

```
Enter the number to count up to: 5

Counting from 1 to 5:
1 2 3 4 5 

Countdown from 5 to 1:
5 4 3 2 1 

Counter program completed!
```

## Code Structure

The program uses:
- `iostream` for input/output operations
- `for` loops for counting operations
- `cin` for user input
- `cout` for displaying output
